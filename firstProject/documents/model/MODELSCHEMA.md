## schema

a schema is a blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized and how the relationships among different entities are managed within a database.

A schema

- specifies the tables in a database, fields in table
- determines the relationship between the tables, one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many

```py
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=(("Male", "Male"), ("Female", "Female")), default="Male")
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=10, null=True, blank=True)
    email = models.EmailField()
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()
    student_registration = models.DateTimeField()
    profile_image = models.ImageField(upload_to="images/students")
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)  # Set on creation
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)  # Set on update
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)
    uuid = models.UUIDField(unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


```

Lets go through each of the fields.

1. `CharField`: it is used for storing strings or text based values.

2. `max_length` attribute is required for fields like `CharField` and `SlugField`.

3. `choices` It takes two parameters, first one is the field that will be stored in the database and the second one will be shown to the user.

4. `default`: if not value is provided, the default value will be saved.

```py
gender = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=(("male", "Male"), ("female", "Female")), default="Male")
```

5. `null=True`: This allows the field to be NULL in the database, meaning it can be empty.

6. `blank=True`: This allows the field to be empty in forms or admin panels. blank=True is more related to form validation, while null=True is related to the database. it means the form will accept an empty value for this field, even if the field is required in the database.the database will store an empty string ('') rather than NULL.
7. `date_of_birth = models.DateField()`: it is used for storing dates (year, month, day). This field expects input in a date format and is stored in the database accordingly.
8. `student_registration = models.DateTimeField()`: DateTimeField stores both date and time information in the database when the student was registered.
9. `created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)`: this will automatically set the field to the current timestamp when the record is first created and will not change afterward. it sets the field only once when the object is created (useful for created_at fields).
10. `updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)`: this will automatically set the field to the current timestamp and updated when the record changes.
11. `uuid = models.UUIDField(unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)`: automatically generates a new UUID using Python’s uuid.uuid4() function.
